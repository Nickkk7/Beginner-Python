Here's a Python program to print a little story using 'print()' function.

```python
print("There was a man named Saurabh who was 30 years old")
print("He liked his name Saurabh")
print(""But hated to be 30 years old")
```

Suppose, we wanted to change the name and age of the person. We would have to go change the required data wherever it appears. It's where the importance of variables arises. A variable is a container which can store a particular data. If we change the data in a variable, data changes wherever that variable occurs reducing unnecessay hard work.

To accomplish this task, we'll create two variables, namely character_name and character_age.

 > A variable name can be whatever we want, but for a code to be readable, it's preferred to give it a logical name.
 
 > A variable can't contain spaces in between. Therefore, for a multi-word variable name, underscore (_) is used.
