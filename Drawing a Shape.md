Having taken a quick glance of Python, it's time we get into programming. In this topic, we're going to learn how to draw a shape.

> **We strongly recommend to try it yourself before reading further.**

In 'Hello World' program, we used a `print()` function to print a statement. Now to draw a shape, we can simply use a combination of print statements. It should be kept in mind to not dive into writing a code as soon as you see a problem. Observe and analyse the problem properly and think about the solution. A language is just a way of writing a solution to the problem.

Here, our objective is to make a triangle. We'll keep the following in mind while writing the code (It solely depends on you 
the type of triangle or the shape you want to make).
