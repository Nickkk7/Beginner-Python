A comment is a statement which is not executed by the interpretor. It's simply avoided by the interpretor. A comment can be implemeted by using a `#` (hashtag) symbol.

```python
# A python program to show implementation of comment

```

#### Explanation-
The comment added tells what the program is about.

A comment can also be written alongside a statement to write its explanation etc.

```python
x = 5
print(str(x))  # printing 'x' as a string rather than an integer
```

## Applications of Comments-

1) Writing what the program is about
2) Writing explanation of a statement of a program
3) Comment a part of the code during testing
